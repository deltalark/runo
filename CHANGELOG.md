# Changelog

All notable changes to Runo are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Connections: run sessions on this machine, in a Cove VM (local or on a server) or on any SSH server, and move a session between them from its header. Files, uncommitted changes and the agent's conversation are synced over the connection before and after every turn, and terminals open there.
- Settings → Connections with Test, VM size, network and idle stop for Cove, forwarded keys, optional GitHub access, and a list of this machine's Cove VMs.
- Agents can use connections themselves through Runo's MCP server (`list_connections`, `run_on`) and Cove's own tools.
- Playbooks as shareable `.playbook.md` files: install from a git repo, link, folder or the clipboard, export, update from the source, inputs asked before a run, and declared permissions.
- Native desktop client in pure Rust for macOS, with Windows and Linux also targeted.
- Projects and sessions with isolated git worktrees, live agent output, real git diffs, a file browser and a command terminal.
- Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode support. Models, permission and sandbox modes, effort and reasoning levels, speed tiers and agents are discovered from each installed CLI.
- Per-agent settings: default model, executable, extra arguments, environment variables and agent-specific options.
- Settings screen with search, light and dark themes, accent colors and colorblind-friendly diff colors.
- Desktop notifications when an agent finishes (macOS and Linux).
